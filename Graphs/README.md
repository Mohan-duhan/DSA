Graph algorithms and problems collection.

## Problems

| # | Problem | Difficulty | Solution | Topics |
|---|---------|-----------|----------|--------|
| 1 | Number of Islands | Medium | Coming Soon | DFS, BFS |
| 2 | Clone Graph | Medium | Coming Soon | Graph Traversal |
| 3 | Course Schedule | Medium | Coming Soon | Topological Sort |
| 4 | Network Delay Time | Medium | Coming Soon | Dijkstra |

## Key Algorithms

### Graph Traversal
- **BFS (Breadth-First Search)** - Level-order traversal
- **DFS (Depth-First Search)** - Recursive/Stack-based

### Shortest Path
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm** - Single source shortest path
- **Bellman-Ford** - Handles negative weights
- **Floyd-Warshall** - All pairs shortest path

### Minimum Spanning Tree
- **Kruskal's Algorithm** - Edge-based MST
- **Prim's Algorithm** - Vertex-based MST

### Advanced Topics
- Topological Sort
- Strongly Connected Components
- Union-Find (Disjoint Set)
- Cycle Detection

## Graph Representations
- Adjacency Matrix
- Adjacency List
- Edge List
